## Release v2.6.0 - October 27, 2025

### What Went Wrong ❌

#### Issue 1: Tag Not on Main Branch (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: v2.6.0 tag pointed to a commit that didn't exist on the main branch
- GitHub showed: "This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository"
- Release was not visible as "Latest" on the front page
- Created confusion about which version was current

**Root Cause**:
- Tag was created BEFORE local main branch was pushed to origin
- Local main was 86 commits ahead of origin/main
- Tag creation workflow was: `git tag` → `git push origin tag` (missing `git push origin main` first)

**Impact**:
- Release appeared incomplete
- Users couldn't find the latest version
- Required manual force-push to fix tag location
- Wasted 2+ hours troubleshooting

**Lesson Learned**:
- **ALWAYS** push main branch BEFORE creating tags
- **ALWAYS** verify local main is synced with origin/main BEFORE tagging
- Use `git fetch origin && git log origin/main..main` to check if ahead
- If output shows commits, push main first

**Prevention** (Now in PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md):
```bash
# Step 1: Verify sync
git fetch origin
git status  # Should show "up to date with origin/main"

# Step 2: Push main if ahead
git push origin main

# Step 3: Create tag (now guaranteed to be on main)
git tag -a v2.6.0 -m "Release v2.6.0"

# Step 4: Push tag
git push origin v2.6.0

# Step 5: Verify tag is on main branch
git branch --contains v2.6.0  # Should show "main"
```

#### Issue 2: Inconsistent Version References (HIGH)
**Problem**: Documentation contained 6+ references to v2.5.0 instead of v2.6.0
- Demo video section still referenced v2.5.0
- Terminal output examples showed wrong version
- HTML reports description outdated
- JSON example had old version number
- Comparison table headers wrong

**Root Cause**:
- No automated version consistency checking
- Manual find/replace is error-prone
- Version numbers scattered across documentation
- No single source of truth for version

**Impact**:
- Users confused about which version they had
- Documentation appeared unmaintained
- Reduced credibility
- Required post-release fix

**Lesson Learned**:
- Version numbers should be templated or generated
- Use search to find ALL version references before release
- Check: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, Cargo.toml, package.json, docs/*
- Consider using a version variable that's expanded in docs

**Prevention** (Now in PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md):
```bash
# Search for old version references
grep -r "v2\.5" README.md docs/ CHANGELOG.md
grep -r "2\.5\.0" README.md docs/ CHANGELOG.md
grep -r '"version": "2\.5' Cargo.toml package.json

# All should return ZERO results before release
```

#### Issue 3: GitHub Token Management (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Multiple GitHub tokens expired or invalid during release
- First token: `ghp_***[REDACTED]***` → 401 Bad credentials
- Second token (from git remote): `ghp_***[REDACTED]***` → 401 Bad credentials
- Required user to provide fresh token

**Root Cause**:
- Tokens not stored in secure location
- No token expiration tracking
- Used expired tokens without verification
- No backup authentication method

**Impact**:
- Interrupted release flow
- Required user intervention
- Wasted time troubleshooting authentication
- Security risk if tokens leaked in logs

**Lesson Learned**:
- Store GitHub tokens in environment variables or secure vault
- Test token BEFORE starting release process
- Use token with appropriate scopes (repo, write:packages)
- Set calendar reminders for token expiration (GitHub tokens last 1 year max)
- Consider using GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`) instead of raw tokens

**Prevention** (Now in PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md):
```bash
# Test token before release
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/user | jq -r '.login'

# Should show your username, not 401 error
# If 401, refresh token before continuing
```

#### Issue 4: GitHub Release "Latest" Flag Not Set (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Even after publishing v2.6.0, GitHub still showed v2.5.0 as "Latest"
- Multiple attempts to set `make_latest: true` via API
- Unclear which release was current on GitHub UI
- Front page didn't highlight newest release

**Root Cause**:
- GitHub API sometimes requires explicit latest flag
- Simply publishing a new release doesn't always auto-promote it
- Combined with "tag not on branch" issue

**Impact**:
- Users downloading old version
- Confusion about current release
- Poor first impression

**Lesson Learned**:
- Always explicitly set `make_latest: true` when creating GitHub release
- Verify on GitHub UI (not just API) that correct release is shown
- Check https://github.com/user/repo/releases immediately after publishing

**Prevention** (Now in PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md):
```bash
# When creating release via API, include:
{
  "tag_name": "v2.6.0",
  "name": "v2.6.0 - Feature Summary",
  "body": "Release notes...",
  "make_latest": true  # ← CRITICAL: Don't forget this
}

# Verify:
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/user/repo/releases/latest | \
  jq -r '.tag_name'

# Should output: v2.6.0
```

## Release Process Improvements for v3.0.0

### Before Starting Release

1. **Version Consistency Audit** (15 minutes)
   - Search ALL files for old version references
   - Use automated script: `scripts/check_version_consistency.sh`
   - Update: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, Cargo.toml, docs/, examples/

2. **Token Verification** (5 minutes)
   - Verify GitHub token is valid
   - Check token scopes include `repo` and `write:packages`
   - Export to environment: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...`
   - Test with: `gh auth status` or API call

3. **Git Sync Verification** (5 minutes)
   - Ensure local main is up-to-date with origin
   - Run: `git fetch origin && git status`
   - If ahead: `git push origin main`
   - If behind: `git pull origin main`

### During Release

4. **Tag Creation Workflow** (10 minutes)
   - Step 1: Push main branch
   - Step 2: Create annotated tag locally
   - Step 3: Verify tag points to HEAD
   - Step 4: Push tag to origin
   - Step 5: Verify tag is on main branch

5. **GitHub Release Creation** (15 minutes)
   - Use `gh release create` CLI (preferred)
   - Or use API with `make_latest: true`
   - Include comprehensive release notes
   - Attach binaries if applicable
   - Verify release shows as "Latest" on GitHub

6. **Documentation Update** (20 minutes)
   - Update README.md with new version
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
   - Update any version references in docs/
   - Commit changes: "Update documentation for vX.Y.Z"
   - Push to main branch

### After Release

7. **Verification Steps** (15 minutes)
   - Visit GitHub releases page → Verify "Latest" badge
   - Clone fresh repo → Verify version matches
   - Run `cargo install` → Verify correct version installs
   - Check Docker Hub → Verify image tagged correctly
   - Test download links → Verify binaries work

8. **Communication** (30 minutes)
   - Post to GitHub Discussions → Announce release
   - Update project README.md → Feature highlights
   - Tweet/social media → Share release notes
   - Update documentation site → New version docs

9. **Monitoring** (24 hours)
   - Watch GitHub Issues → New bug reports?
   - Check download metrics → Adoption rate?
   - Monitor social media → User feedback?
   - Review crash reports → Any critical issues?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: "Ship It and Fix Later"
**Problem**: Rushing release without proper verification
**Why It Fails**: Leads to broken releases, user confusion, wasted time
**Instead**: Use PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md systematically, verify each step

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: "Manual Version Updates"
**Problem**: Manually updating version numbers across multiple files
**Why It Fails**: Easy to miss files, inconsistent versions, human error
**Instead**: Use automated script or single source of truth for version

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: "Tag Now, Push Later"
**Problem**: Creating tags before pushing main branch
**Why It Fails**: Tags point to orphaned commits, releases appear broken
**Instead**: Always push main FIRST, then create and push tags

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: "Works on My Machine"
**Problem**: Not testing release artifacts on clean environment
**Why It Fails**: Local environment differs from users, hidden dependencies
**Instead**: Test on fresh VM or container, verify clean install works

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: "Documentation Can Wait"
**Problem**: Releasing without updating documentation
**Why It Fails**: Users confused, no migration guide, outdated examples
**Instead**: Update documentation BEFORE release, make it part of checklist

## Conclusion

v2.6.0 taught us valuable lessons about release management:
1. **Git workflow matters** - Tags must be on main branch
2. **Verification is critical** - Don't assume, always verify
3. **Automation prevents errors** - Checklists and scripts help
4. **Documentation is release-critical** - Not an afterthought

By documenting these lessons and creating systematic processes (PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md), we ensure v3.0.0 and future releases are smoother, faster, and more reliable.

**Remember**: Every mistake is an opportunity to improve. This document exists so we learn once and never repeat the same mistake.
